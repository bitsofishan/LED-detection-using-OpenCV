# LED detection using OpenCV for Satellite
The aim of the project is to determine the coordinates of 5 different led to determine the pose/attitude of the target satellite.Using the led pattern on the target satellite, the chaser satellite is able to determine the attitude of the target satellite.Using OpenCV,the program is able to detect 5 different colors in the frame with the coordinates.
